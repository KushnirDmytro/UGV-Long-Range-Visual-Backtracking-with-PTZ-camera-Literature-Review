Incorporate both "background" and "foreground" contributions.

Action Points Based on the Assignment Guidelines

    Understand the Topic Scope:
        Define the specific focus area of your master's project or research.
        Refine the topic iteratively based on literature findings, aligning with your proposal (e.g., backtracking recovery in UGVs using PTZ cameras).

    Systematic Literature Search and Selection:
        Use tools like Google Scholar, arXiv, and OpenAlex to identify relevant literature.
        Focus on:
            Representativeness: Ensure the selected works cover the major research directions.
            Relevance: Select works directly contributing to your research questions (e.g., visual landmark-based navigation).

    Evaluate and Analyze the Literature:
        Perform terminology saturation analysis to check representativeness.
        Classify works by subtopics, e.g.:
            Hybrid topological-metric mapping.
            Visual landmark detection and recognition techniques.
            Navigation and path planning algorithms for unstructured environments.
        Identify research gaps, such as limitations of current PTZ systems or VLLM applicability in sparse semantic landscapes.

    Structure the Review:
        Follow the suggested structure:
            Introduction: Motivation for the topic.
            Methodology: How you collected and analyzed the literature.
            State-of-the-Art: Subsections for different aspects, like mapping approaches, visual perception.
            Research Gaps: Highlight areas for improvement or new explorations.
            Conclusion and Motivation: Refine why your research challenge matters.
        Incorporate both "background" and "foreground" contributions.

    Use Appropriate Writing Style:
        Present insights logically and maintain clarity.
        Utilize comparative analysis tables, graphs, or figures where appropriate.

    Document Technical Methodology:
        Include details on any tools (e.g., snowball sampling for literature selection).
        Explain the evaluation criteria used to assess representativeness and relevance.


## Reading Notes

### Autonomous Driving in Unstructured Environments:  How Far Have We Come?

For Pose Estimation there are 3 directions of Matching-based Methods

1) Matching with High-Definition Map

> Another significant focus is on long-term localization strategies that adapt to changing environments. The PoseMap [11] addresses the challenges of reliable localization over extended periods by extracting distinctive features from range measurements and bundling them into local views with observation poses. This method maintains a distributed map composed

2) Matching with Lightweight Map

> In [93], lightweight semantic object maps are incorporated to guide relocalization in unstructured environments. This method associates and registers the vehicleâ€™s local semantic object map with a compact semantic reference map built from various viewpoints, time periods, and modalities. A graphbased data association algorithm ensures robustness to noise, outliers, and missing objects, significantly improving global localization accuracy in non-urban and urban settings.


3) Place Recognition / Relocalization
