abstract = {Openly shared low-cost electronic hardware applications, known as open electronics, have sparked a new open-source movement, with much untapped potential to advance scientific research. Initially designed to appeal to electronic hobbyists, open electronics have formed a global “maker” community and are increasingly used in science and industry. In this perspective article, we review the current costs and benefits of open electronics for use in scientific research ranging from the experimental to the theoretical sciences. We discuss how user-made electronic applications can help (I) individual researchers, by increasing the customization, efficiency, and scalability of experiments, while improving data quantity and quality; (II) scientific institutions, by improving access to customizable high-end technologies, sustainability, visibility, and interdisciplinary collaboration potential; and (III) the scientific community, by improving transparency and reproducibility, helping decouple research capacity from funding, increasing innovation, and improving collaboration potential among researchers and the public. We further discuss how current barriers like poor awareness, knowledge access, and time investments can be resolved by increased documentation and collaboration, and provide guidelines for academics to enter this emerging field. We highlight that open electronics are a promising and powerful tool to help scientific research to become more innovative and reproducible and offer a key practical solution to improve democratic access to science.},

ABSTRACT = {OpenHSI is an initiative to lower the barriers of entry and bring compact pushbroom hyperspectral imaging spectrometers to a wider audience. We present an open-source optical design that can be replicated with readily available commercial-off-the-shelf components, and an open-source software platform openhsi that simplifies the process of capturing calibrated hyperspectral datacubes. Some of the features that the software stack provides include: an ISO 19115-2 metadata editor, wavelength calibration, a fast smile correction method, radiance conversion, atmospheric correction using 6SV (an open-source radiative transfer code), and empirical line calibration. A pipeline was developed to customise the desired processing and make openhsi practical for real-time use. We used the OpenHSI optical design and software stack successfully in the field and verified the performance using calibration tarpaulins. By providing all the tools needed to collect documented hyperspectral datasets, our work empowers practitioners who may not have the financial or technical capability to operate commercial hyperspectral imagers, and opens the door for applications in new problem domains.},

abstract = {A comprehensive radiometric characterization of raw-data format imagery acquired with the Raspberry Pi 3 and V2.1 camera module is presented. The Raspberry Pi is a high-performance single-board computer designed to educate and solve real-world problems. This small computer supports a camera module that uses a Sony IMX219 8 megapixel CMOS sensor. This paper shows that scientific and engineering-grade imagery can be produced with the Raspberry Pi 3 and its V2.1 camera module. Raw imagery is shown to be linear with exposure and gain (ISO), which is essential for scientific and engineering applications. Dark frame, noise, and exposure stability assessments along with flat fielding results, spectral response measurements, and absolute radiometric calibration results are described. This low-cost imaging sensor, when calibrated to produce scientific quality data, can be used in computer vision, biophotonics, remote sensing, astronomy, high dynamic range imaging, and security applications, to name a few.},
