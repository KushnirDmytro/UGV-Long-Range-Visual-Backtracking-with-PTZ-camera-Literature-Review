## Task: publish the literatrue review paper on topic

Issues:
- This assignment helped to identify the "form" of the field:
- Targeted problem requires composition of lots of subproblems, which are unavoidable.
- Plenty of review papers on each subtopic already. Fild is littered with those.
- The direct problem is not yet solved, but the subproblems are.
- Actual approach requires existing and supported solutions. -- Filter!

Derrived Issues:
- Snowballing on such a field structure is not feasible.


Solutions (approved by Ermolayev)
- Make a "Design" paper, based on the papers found. Kind of a "Structured review" thing
- At first find, define the problem frame, why we do it
- Snowballing can be done later, before the full paper proposal
